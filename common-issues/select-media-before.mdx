## Is the media analyzed?

You first need to [analyze your footage](/core-concepts/processing) before it becomes searchable. The middle column selects files to be visually analysed, the right column for the audio to be transcribed. Press the big Process selection button at the bottom of Jumperâ€™s media table.

After that, the left column checkbox can be selected to include the file that were analysed in your searches, which you can tell because the checkbox for visual and/or audio processing turned green.

## Is the license correctly entered?

Make sure you've entered the license key correctly. The License key input should have a green border and a green tick.

## Included in search?

The first column with checkboxes in the [Media tab](/interface/media-tab) controls whether to include or exclude the media files when you search. Check to see if the media you want to search in is checked.

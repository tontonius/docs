### **Jumper is not showing up in the Extension menu in Adobe Premiere Pro**

On macOS sure you start the Jumper launcher app via Spotlight after installing the .DMG file you downloaded. If it's still not showing up, you can download a third-party installation tool called [ZXPInstaller](https://zxpinstaller.com/). Open the program after downloading and installing it, then drag-and-drop the zxp-file into the program.

#### Location of the zxp-file 

macOS: `/Applications/Jumper.app/Contents/Resources/Jumper.zxp`\
Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jumper\_internal\Jumper.zxp`

### Jumper is not showing up in the Tools menu in Avid

We're not really sure what causes this issue but several users have found rebooting the computer will solve it.

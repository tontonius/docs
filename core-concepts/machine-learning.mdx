## Choosing the Right Model

Depending on your specific workflow, usecase and hardware setup, you might want to choose a specific model other than the default. Some suggestions are listed below, or feel free to explore from all the available models.

<Card title="Balanced for Most Users" icon="sparkles" iconType="solid" horizontal="true">
  **V2 Medium (Default):** Good performance vs. speed trade-off. Works well on most machines. Use unless you have a clear reason not to
</Card>

<Card title="Best Accuracy (Heavy-Duty Use / Powerful Machines)" icon="sparkles" iconType="solid" horizontal="true">
  - **V2 XLarge x-high-res:** Absolute top-tier quality. Ideal for fine detail, tough searches, OCR. Needs high RAM/VRAM
  - **V2 Large x-high-res:** Slightly smaller than XLarge, still excellent. Ideal for text/image detail and accuracy

See below for a more detailed list of the models and their properties.

## Visual models

| **Model Name (Display)**       | **Resolution** | **Size on Disk** | **Information**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **V2 Medium (Default)**        | 256Ã—256        | ~1.5GB           | **Default, bundled in app installer**<br />Balanced accuracy vs. performance, improved semantic understanding from V2 model improvements. Works well on most modern computers.                                             |
| **V2 Multilingual x-high-res** | 512x512        | ~2GB             | **NEW, MOST ACCURATE MODEL** ðŸ’ª Fantastic search result quality in both non-English **and** English languages. Improves accuracy on multilingual benchmarks by **50%** compared to default model. **Highly recommended\!** |
| **V2 Medium high-res**         | 384Ã—384        | ~1.5GB           | Identical parameter count as V2 Medium but processes frames at 384Ã—384 for more image detail. Good if you need slightly finer detail than 256Ã—256, but be aware it requires more RAM/VRAM.                                 |
| **V2 Medium x-high-res**       | 512Ã—512        | ~1.5GB           | Same parameter count as V2 Medium, but even higher resolution (512Ã—512). Ideal for text detection/OCR or detailed reverse image searches. Uses significantly more memory and produces larger analysis files.               |
| **V2 Large**                   | 256Ã—256        | ~3.3GB           | Larger model with higher accuracy in challenging scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **V2 Large high-res**          | 384Ã—384        | ~3.3GB           | Same as V2 Large but with higher resolution (384Ã—384). Ideal for text detection/OCR or detailed reverse image searches.                                                                                                    |
| **V2 Large x-high-res**        | 512Ã—512        | ~3.3GB           | Same parameters as V2 Large, but at 512Ã—512 input resolution. Ideal for text detection/OCR or detailed reverse image searches.                                                                                             |
| **V2 XLarge**                  | 256Ã—256        | ~4.5GB           | Even larger V2 model. Offers improved recognition of subtle elements. Ideal if you want top-tier accuracy and have the computer to run it.                                                                                 |
| **V2 XLarge high-res**         | 384Ã—384        | ~4.5GB           | A higher-resolution variant of V2 XLarge.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **V2 XLarge x-high-res**       | 512Ã—512        | ~4.5GB           | The heaviest V2 model in terms of resolution and parameter requirements. Even more accurate, even more resource demanding.                                                                                                 |
| **Medium**                     | 256Ã—256        | ~812MB           | Legacy previous default model (V1), previously bundled with the application. Reasonably accurate but outperformed by V2 Medium in most scenarios. If your hardware can handle V2 Medium, prefer that instead.              |
| **Medium x-high-res**          | 512Ã—512        | ~812MB           | Same as V1 Medium but at 512Ã—512. Useful for text detection, reverse image searches, etc. Produces larger analysis files than some bigger V1 models, purely due to the higher frame resolution.                            |
| **Large multilingual**         | 256Ã—256        | ~1.48GB          | V1 Multilingual version that improves accuracy for non-English text. V2 equivalents are multilingual by default.                                                                                                           |
| **Large**                      | 256Ã—256        | ~2.61GB          | Larger V1 model. Prefer V2 alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Large high-res**             | 384Ã—384        | ~2.61GB          | Same as V1 Large but higher resolution. Demands more resources.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **XLarge high-res**            | 384Ã—384        | ~3.51GB          | Largest V1 model. High accuracy, but overshadowed by the new V2 XLarge. Recommended only for legacy compatibility if you can't run V2.                                                                                     |
| **XLarge multilingual**        | 256Ã—256        | ~4.51GB          | Largest V1 multilingual model. Very high accuracy for non-English searches - V2 models are multilingual by default, but V1 multilingual models can be slightly better than V2 models on certain languages.                 |

## Speech models

For transcriptions, Jumper uses **Whisper** models developed by OpenAI. The exact model depends on your platform.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Analysis files

When Jumper analyzes media, an analysis file is created in the specified `Analysis folder`. This file is required for Jumper to be able to search in that file.

Once analyzed, you may rename or move the original media files as you wish. The analysis files are linked by the content of the media files, not their filepath or filename.

If you delete any of these files, you will need to re-analyze the corrresponding media files.

Jumper relies on advanced machine learning models to find things in your footage.

### Search by text

The most common way to search is by text. Simply type whatever you're looking for in the Search box and click Search.

Searching by text works best in english but if you have analyzed your footage with a [multilingual model](/core-concepts/machine-learning), Jumper will find what you're looking for in ~80 languages. For example you can search for `white cat`, `gato blanco` or `白い猫` and most likely get the same results

  With a multilingual model, you can search in other languages.

### Search by image

Another way is to use an image to search. When searching by image, Jumper will look at the image provided and find scenes in your footage with visual similarity to the search image. This can be especially useful for finding more footage of the same person, location or setting.

## **Monthly Subscription**

### **Refund Eligibility**

We want you to be completely satisfied with your experience. If, for any reason, Jumper doesn't work for you, you are eligible for a refund. Simply submit your refund request within 14 days of your original purchase or renewal date, and we'll process it for you.

### **Partial Refunds**

After 14 days, no refunds will be provided for the current billing cycle, but you may cancel your subscription to prevent future charges.

### **Auto-Renewal**

Monthly subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled. You may cancel at any time, but once a renewal charge has been processed, refunds are subject to the 7-day refund window.

### **Refund Eligibility**

We want you to have the best experience with Jumper. If, for any reason, Jumper doesn't work for you, you are eligible for a refund. Just submit your refund request within 14 days of your original purchase or renewal date, and we'll take care of it for you.

### **Partial Refunds**

No partial refunds will be provided after the 14-day period, but you may cancel your subscription to avoid future renewal charges.

You now need to make sure you have a shortcut key for **Paste Timecode** enabled for best performance, so read on...

### Paste Timecode

In order for Jumper to work as fast and reliably as possible in Final Cut Pro, you need to make sure you assign the **Paste Timecode** shortcut within the Final Cut Pro Command Editor to SOMETHING.

It doesn't matter what keyboard shortcut you use - it just need to be assigned to SOMETHING.

As of **Final Cut Pro 11**, Final Cut Pro now has a default shortcut key for **Paste Timecode**.

For those using earlier versions of Final Cut Pro, or who have customised their keyboard shortcuts...

If you click a thumbnail in Jumper without a shortcut key assigned, Jumper will display this notification:

![](../static/paste-timecode-01.png)

If you hover over the notification, a button will appear (this is terrible UI design, but it's from Apple, and not something we can control):

![](../static/paste-timecode-02.png)

When you click it you'll see a new notification like this:

![](../static/paste-timecode-04.png)

And the Command Editor will automatically select the **Paste Timecode** entry:

![](../static/paste-timecode-03.png)

You can now assign it to whatever you want, save your Command Set, and now Jumper can use it\!

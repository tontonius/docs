## Why do Jumper need these permissions?

Due to technical limitations in FCP's native API, Jumper needs to use macOS's built-in Accessibility API to make things work. More information about why can be found at the bottom of this page

## Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Jumper from the dmg">
    Open the `.dmg` file that has been downloaded from the website.
    ![install-01.png](/images/install-01.png)

    Drag the `Jumper` application into your `Applications` folder.
    You can now launch `Jumper` by double clicking on it within your `Applications` folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Jumper for Final Cut Pro">
    Tick the **Enable Jumper in Final Cut Pro** toggle box

    ![mac-fcp-install-01.png](/images/mac-fcp-install-01.png)

    You now need to enable all the necessary permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Accessibility Permission">
    Click the first **Accessibility Permissions** toggle.
    You'll see this alert:

    ![install-05.png](/images/install-05.png)

    Click **OK**.

    You'll see this alert:

    ![install-06.png](/images/install-06.png)

    Click **Open System Settings**.

    Tick the **Jumper Accessibility Helper** toggle:

    ![install-07.png](/images/install-07.png)

    You'll be prompted to enter your system password (or use Touch ID):

    ![install-08.png](/images/install-08.png)

    After entering your system password, **Jumper Accessibility Helper** should now be ticked.

    ![install-09.png](/images/install-09.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Screen Recording Permission">
    Now go back to `Jumper.app` and tick the next checkbox. You'll be presented with:

    ![install-10.png](/images/install-10.png)

    Click **OK**.

    You'll see this alert:

    ![install-11.png](/images/install-11.png)

    Click **Open System Settings**.

    It will look like this:

    ![install-12.png](/images/install-12.png)

    Click the toggle next to `Jumper`.

    You'll be prompted to enter your system password (or use Touch ID):

    ![install-13.png](/images/install-13.png)

    After entering your system password, you'll be presented with:

    ![install-14.png](/images/install-14.png)

    Click **Later** and go back to `Jumper.app`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Full Disk Access Permission">
    Click the **Full Disk Access Permission** toggle.

    You'll be presented with:

    ![install-15.png](/images/install-15.png)

    Click **OK**.

    You'll be presented with:

    ![install-16.png](/images/install-16.png)

    Click **Allow**.

    In **System Settings** find **Jumper** and click the toggle:

    ![install-17.png](/images/install-17.png)

    You'll be presented with:

    ![install-18.png](/images/install-18.png)

    Click **Quit & Reopen**. This will restart `Jumper.app`.

    Everything should now be ticked in `Jumper.app` like the below:

    ![install-19.png](/images/install-19.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Jumper in FCP">
    Click **Open Final Cut Pro**.

    You can now access Jumper from the Workflow Extension toolbar icon:

    ![install-20.png](/images/install-20.png)

    And from the **Window \> Extensions \> Jumper** menu item:

    ![install-21.png](/images/install-21.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Paste Timecode shortcut">
    In order for Jumper to work as fast and reliably as possible in Final Cut Pro, you need to make sure you assign the **Paste Timecode** shortcut within the Final Cut Pro Command Editor to SOMETHING.

    It doesn't matter what keyboard shortcut you use - it just need to be assigned to SOMETHING.

    As of **Final Cut Pro 11**, Final Cut Pro now has a default shortcut key for **Paste Timecode**.

    For those using earlier versions of Final Cut Pro, or who have customised their keyboard shortcuts...

    If you click a thumbnail in Jumper without a shortcut key assigned, Jumper will display this notification:

    ![paste-timecode-01.png](/images/paste-timecode-01.png)

    If you hover over the notification, a button will appear (this is terrible UI design, but it's from Apple, and not something we can control):

    ![paste-timecode-02.png](/images/paste-timecode-02.png)

    When you click it you'll see a new notification like this:

    ![paste-timecode-04.png](/images/paste-timecode-04.png)

    And the Command Editor will automatically select the **Paste Timecode** entry:

    ![paste-timecode-03.png](/images/paste-timecode-03.png)

    You can now assign it to whatever you want, save your Command Set, and now Jumper can use it\!
  </Step>

## About the permissions

### Accessibility Permission

Jumper requires Accessibility Permission to trigger commands and menu bar items in Final Cut Pro through macOS's built-in Accessibility Automation.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

We use the Accessibility API to programatically "click" on buttons and menu bar items - similar to how Automator, Keyboard Maestro, BetterTouchTool, etc. works.

### Screen Recording Permission

Jumper requires the Screen Recording permission to detect things on your screen when using Final Cut Pro.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

This is a new Security Setting that started in macOS Catalina.

Jumper does not record the screen.

We're not "recording" the screen as a video like a QuickTime Player or a screen recording application would do - we're simply using Apple's APIs to get access to information about the contents of the screen.

We use Apple's API's to get the name of windows that are open.

We also use the API's to help detect when Final Cut Pro is playing and paused, by "looking" at the play/pause button in the Viewer.

Nothing is saved to disk. Nothing is transmitted online.

We simply use Apple's APIs to access screen information.

We also have the option of OPTIONALLY sending screenshots when you submit feedback.

Lots of other applications like Bartender and BetterTouchTool have this same limitation.

We use the same techniques as the totally open-source CommandPost, so you can always inspect their code to see what's going on.

### Full Disk Access Permission

Jumper requires Full Disk Access to read Final Cut Pro's Preferences File (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FinalCut.plist) and the current Final Cut Pro Command Set.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

Due to macOS's very tight security in recent releases, we need explicit permission to read files inside the user's Library folder.

We only use this permission to read Final Cut Pro preferences files.

## Is Jumper compatible with CommandPost?

Yes\! Although Jumper does have a specialised version of CommandPost running under the hood (we called it the Final Cut Pro Automation Engine in Jumper.app and Jumper Accessibility Helper in Activity Monitor), it's fully compatible with Jumper.

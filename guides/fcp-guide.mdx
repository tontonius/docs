  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Jumper in FCP">
    Click **Open Final Cut Pro**.

    And from the **Window \> Extensions \> Jumper** menu item:

    ![install-21.png](/images/install-21.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Paste Timecode shortcut">
    In order for Jumper to work as fast and reliably as possible in Final Cut Pro, you need to make sure you assign the **Paste Timecode** shortcut within the Final Cut Pro Command Editor to SOMETHING.

    It doesn't matter what keyboard shortcut you use - it just need to be assigned to SOMETHING.

    As of **Final Cut Pro 11**, Final Cut Pro now has a default shortcut key for **Paste Timecode**.

    For those using earlier versions of Final Cut Pro, or who have customised their keyboard shortcuts...

    If you click a thumbnail in Jumper without a shortcut key assigned, Jumper will display this notification:

    ![paste-timecode-01.png](/images/paste-timecode-01.png)

    If you hover over the notification, a button will appear (this is terrible UI design, but it's from Apple, and not something we can control):

    ![paste-timecode-02.png](/images/paste-timecode-02.png)

    When you click it you'll see a new notification like this:

    ![paste-timecode-04.png](/images/paste-timecode-04.png)

    And the Command Editor will automatically select the **Paste Timecode** entry:

    ![paste-timecode-03.png](/images/paste-timecode-03.png)

    You can now assign it to whatever you want, save your Command Set, and now Jumper can use it\!

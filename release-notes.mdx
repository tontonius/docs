<Update label="2025-04-07" description="Build 1682">
  **🔨 Improvements**

  - Cache size reduced by ~90% (100mb vs 1gb for same files)
  - Robust cache reading with fallbacks, backward compatible with old method
  - Support for vision models using MLX framework on Apple silicon
  - Frame batch size calculation based on host machine specs (faster processing if you have more memory)
  - Improved GPU memory cache handling when switching models
  - Validate and delete invalid cache files

  **🐞 Bug Fixes**

  - Fix intermittent failures in reading and writing settings
</Update>

<Update label="2025-04-03" description="Build 1665">
  **🔨 Improvements**

  - Dynamically resolve batch size of video frames by host machine RAM/VRAM - will speed up analysis for those of you with more powerful machines
  - A visual indicator will show if the search result is imported in the project or not - if it's not, the bottom left button of the thumbnail will locate the file on your filesystem in Finder of File Explorer
  - Fix concurrency issues loading/unloading non-project media from Analysis folder
  - Various small improvements to backend stability

  **🐞 Bug Fixes**

  - Fix missing start_timecode in metadata cache
  - Fix R3D file processing with "V2 Multilingual x-high-res" model (did I tell you already this model is the really, really good?)
  - Add default Premiere target a/v track offset to settings file creation
</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-30" description="Build 1637">
  **🆕 Important Changes**

  - **New AI model "V2 Multilingual x-high-res" added**
  - This one is fantastic - increases accuracy on multilingual benchmarks by **50%** compared to our default V2 Medium model, while also showing excellent performance when using English searches. The downside is that analysis takes a bit longer on macOS - Windows users with Nvidia GPUs will process significantly faster.
  - **You can now search all previously analysed footage inside your Analysis folder**
  - Instead of being limited to only searching in your current project media, you can now toggle an option to search in all the media you have ever analysed. The media of search results can be located on your filesystem by clicking the lower-left button to "Show in filesystem", so you can import them into your project more easily. An automated "import to project" solution will be added in a future release.

  **🔨 Improvements**

  - Visual analysis processing speed increased for all models by optimising the frame extraction from videos (~30% speedup)
  - More comprehensive permission handling (ensuring read/write permission for Analysis folder in multi-user environments)

  **🐞 Bug Fixes**

  - Fix missing default setting for timeline audio/video track target in Premiere
</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-10" description="Build 1620">
  **🆕 Important Changes**

  - **Update to V2 visual models**. We now use new AI model architectures that improves visual searches in a number of ways, and are multilingual by default. Read more here https://docs.getjumper.io/models/
  - ⚠️
  - You will need to re-process your footage - it will be fast and is highly recommended. If you still want to use the old model, download and load the **Medium** model instead of the new default **V2 Medium**.
  - **Multilingual Support**:
    - V2 models handle searches in any language, improving non-English text and concept recognition. V1 multilingual models (e.g., **Large multilingual**) may still excel in specific languages like Hindi or Thai.
    - Jumper's interface is now translated into different languages - currently supporting **Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Swedish**.
  - Analysis file sharing between different machines is available for paid licenses (e.g. put analysis folder on a shared location, like on a NAS)
  - Optimised processing of the same footage to the same analysis folder by multiple machines at the same time (e.g. process the same footage from 10 individual editor machines concurrently)

  **🔨 Improvements**

  - As mentioned above, lots of improvements to visual searches - see https://docs.getjumper.io/models/
  - Add onboarding flow and revamp About/Help section
  - Faster visual processing speeds due to optimisations in open source dependencies

  **🐞 Bug Fixes**

  - Fix bug when selecting/deselecting all checkboxes for which files should be included in searches - thanks for reporting @Nicklas
  - Fix bug when searching using copied Pasteboard image when saved in TIFF instead of PNG format - thanks for reporting @CharlesTeton

  - We've done major changes to how the Media panel works in Final Cut Pro.
  - Rather than automagically loading all the media from your Library, you now just drag in the Library or Event(s) you want to work with.
  - This makes managing clips in the Media panel a lot easier, as you can just bring in the rushes you want to work with in Jumper, leaving out all the graphics, sound effects and music you might already have in your Library.

  **🆕 Important Changes**

  - Jumper on macOS is now code-signed by Witchcraft Software AB.

  - Jumper now runs on Intel Mac's. Currently we have seperate binaries for Intel and Apple Silicon, whilst we explore building a Universal binary.

  **🔨 Improvements**

  - We have implemented offline license checking for valid non-trial licenses. This means you can now work entirely offline, once the license is initially validated.
  - When you drag-and-drop a Final Cut Pro Library to the Jumper Media table, we now save this information in the metadata cache, so it's persistent across restarts.

Please visit [getjumper.io](https://getjumper.io) and "buy" either a Subscription or Lifetime license for Final Cut Pro and/or Adobe Premiere. Bundles on the website are currently not hooked up. Use the dummy credit card number `4000 0566 5566 5556` and CVC `100` - you cannot use a real credit card. You will get an email with your new license key. Please report any bugs or issues\! Thanks team\!

  **🆕 Important Changes**

  - We've updated the EULA and copyright messages to reference our new company name, **Witchcraft Software AB**.

  **🔨 Improvements**

  - Added **experimental** support for new CoreML/Neural Engine-based audio transcription. This should dramatically improve transcription speeds on Apple Silicon Mac's. This new technique takes about 9 minutes to initialise the CoreML caches on first install, so we continue to use the older technique until the new CoreML caches are ready.
  - You can now right-click on clips in the **Media** panel to reveal their cache location in Finder. This is useful if you need to delete an Analysis file if you processed in the wrong language, etc.

</Update>

<Update label="2024-09-27" description="889">
  **🔨 Improvements**

  - Improvements to the **experimental** support for Multicam and Synchronised Clips in Final Cut Pro. This is still very much a work-in-progress. After processing the clips you want to use in the Jumper Media panel, drag-and-drop a Library or Event from the Final Cut Pro Browser into the Jumper Media panel in the Workflow Extension. You should see a "FCPXML processed successfully" message. We will use the information in the dragged FCPXML to prioritise Multicam Clips and Synchronised Clips over standard clips. There is currently a bug with selecting the right angle in some cases.
  - Removed Sentry crash reporting from `Jumper.app` and the Final Cut Pro Automation Engine. If you experience any crashes, you'll need to manually send us your crash reports from the `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` folder.
</Update>

Currently this feature works best if the Multicam starting timecode is `00:00:00:00` - this will be improved in a future beta.
  - Under-the-hood performance improvements for Premiere on Mac and Windows.

  **🐞 Bug Fix**

## General
### How fast is the search?
Fast.

We’ve tested on a few different machines (MBP M1, Windows i5 laptop, 2019 Ryzen desktop) and all were able to search through roughly 100 hours of footage in about 0.2 seconds.

We are also actively and constantly trying to improve performance.

### How long does the processing take?
A MacBook M1 Pro can process around 15 minutes of footage in 1 minute.

### What hardware was used in the video?
In the video Jumper was running a MacBook Air M2.

## Getting started
### When I attempt to search it says "Select some media here before searching"

You first need to process/analyse your footage before it becomes searchable. The middle column selects files to be visually analysed, the right column for the audio to be transcribed. Press the big Process selection button at the bottom of Jumper's media table.

After that, the left column checkbox can be selected to include the file that were analysed in your searches, which you can tell because the checkbox for visual and/or audio processing turned green.


#How can I search in other languages than English?
Go to Jumper's settings tab and download one of the multilingual models. Remember to press the Load button once the download is finished.

#Jumper is not showing up in the Extension menu in Adobe Premiere Pro
On macOS sure you start the Jumper launcher app via Spotlight after installing the .DMG file you downloaded. If it's still not showing up, you can download a third-party installation tool called ZXPInstaller. Open the program after downloading and installing it, then drag-and-drop the file located here into the program
macOS: /Applications/Jumper.app/Contents/Resources/Jumper.zxp
Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Jumper\_internal\Jumper.zxp


#Licensing & Account management

There you will see a red trashcan under the "Device fingerprint" for your license. Click the red trash can to sign out the currently active computer. Now you can apply your license key on another computer.

#Does Jumper work with Premiere Productions?
Yes, Jumper will ingest all media in all opened projects (i.e. all projects in the Production). When using functionality such as "Add to timeline", Jumper will use the active timeline, even if it is located in a different project than the source footage for the search result.

#Privacy & Data
#Is any part of my footage uploaded during processing?
No, we don’t upload the data processed from your footage, or any part of your footage.

The processing is done locally and stays on your computer.

#Does Jumper require an Internet connection?
Jumper only requires an Internet connection for license verification.

Once your license key is verified, you can run everything offline - no Internet required.

#What information is sent to Jumper's servers?
Jumper only requires an Internet connection for license verification.

Once your license key is verified, you can run everything offline - no Internet required.

Nothing related to you or your footage ever leaves your computer, apart from licensing information and crash reports.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.

#What firewall settings do I need?
Jumper uses Keygen for managing licenses, and therefore you should whitelist the api.keygen.sh domain in your firewall settings, and *.getjumper.io for software updates.

#Storage & Files
#Does processing the footage create any significant amount of data on one's computer?
When processing footage, Jumper generates Analysis files.

The size of these Analysis files varies depending on a few factors like resolution and frame rate.

As a rough guide, it's around 1MB for every 10 seconds of footage.

#Can I transfer the Analysis Files to another editor’s machine?
Yes, to transfer the Analysis Files on macOS:

Open the Terminal.app from Spotlight, and navigate to the cache directory:

open ~/Library/Application\ Support/
Then you can copy the jumper-cache folder to the same location on the other editor’s machine.

#Will copying the cache overwrite existing files on the receiving machine?
No, copying the Analysis Files will be additive.

It will not overwrite existing files but add to them.

#Can I change the location of my Analysis Files folder?
Yes, you can change the location of your Analysis Files Folder under the Settings tab in Jumper.

#How does Jumper handle multi-channel audio?
Currently Jumper for Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro only processes audio from the first channel that has valid dialogue.

In a future update, Jumper will process all audio channels.

However, on Avid Media Composer, when using Avid Managed Media (i.e. files within your Avid MediaFiles folder) - we will process all audio channels.

#Final Cut Pro
#Accessibility Permission
Jumper requires Accessibility Permission to trigger commands and menu bar items in Final Cut Pro through macOS's built-in Accessibility Automation.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

We use the Accessibility API to programatically "click" on buttons and menu bar items - similar to how Automator, Keyboard Maestro, BetterTouchTool, etc. works.

#Screen Recording Permission
Jumper requires the Screen Recording permission to detect things on your screen when using Final Cut Pro.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

This is a new Security Setting that started in macOS Catalina.

Jumper does not record the screen.

We're not "recording" the screen as a video like a QuickTime Player or a screen recording application would do - we're simply using Apple's APIs to get access to information about the contents of the screen.

We use Apple's API's to get the name of windows that are open.

We also use the API's to help detect when Final Cut Pro is playing and paused, by "looking" at the play/pause button in the Viewer.

Nothing is saved to disk. Nothing is transmitted online.

We simply use Apple's APIs to access screen information.

We also have the option of OPTIONALLY sending screenshots when you submit feedback.

Lots of other applications like Bartender and BetterTouchTool have this same limitation.

We use the same techniques as the totally open-source CommandPost, so you can always inspect their code to see what's going on.

#Full Disk Access Permission
Jumper requires Full Disk Access to read Final Cut Pro's Preferences File (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FinalCut.plist) and the current Final Cut Pro Command Set.

This is only required for Final Cut Pro - it is not required if you're only using Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Avid Media Composer.

Due to macOS's very tight security in recent releases, we need explicit permission to read files inside the user's Library folder.

We only use this permission to read Final Cut Pro preferences files.

#Is Jumper compatible with CommandPost?
Yes! Although Jumper does have a specialised version of CommandPost running under the hood (we called it the Final Cut Pro Automation Engine in Jumper.app and Jumper Accessibility Helper in Activity Monitor), it's fully compatible with Jumper.

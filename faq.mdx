## General

### How fast is the search?

Fast.

Weâ€™ve tested on a few different machines (MBP M1, Windows i5 laptop, 2019 Ryzen desktop) and all were able to search through roughly 100 hours of footage in about 0.2 seconds.

We are also actively and constantly trying to improve performance.

### How long does the processing take?

A MacBook M1 Pro can process around 15 minutes of footage in 1 minute.

### What hardware was used in the video?

In the video Jumper was running a MacBook Air M2.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How fast is the search?">
    Fast.

    We’ve tested on a few different machines (MBP M1, Windows i5 laptop, 2019 Ryzen desktop) and all were able to search through roughly 100 hours of footage in about 0.2 seconds.

    We are also actively and constantly trying to improve performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does the processing take?">
    It depends on your hardware setup and the resolution of the footage.
    A MacBook M1 Pro can process around 15 minutes of footage in 1 minute.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Jumper handle multi-channel audio?">
    Currently Jumper only processes audio from the first channel that has valid dialogue.

    In a future update, Jumper will process all audio channels.

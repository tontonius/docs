## Visual models

## Speech models

For transcriptions, Jumper uses **Whisper** models developed by OpenAI. Specifically, the `whisper-large-v3-turbo` variant is used. The choice of model depends on your platform:

| **Platform**            | **Model Variant**      | **Size on Disk** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                           |

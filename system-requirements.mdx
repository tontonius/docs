  <Tab title="Apple Silicon">
    ### macOS

    Jumper requires **macOS Sonoma 14.0** or later (due to a requirement of **Metal 3.1** for faster processing).

    However, we recommend the latest **macOS Sequoia 15**.

    If you don't already have `ffmpeg` installed on your system, Jumper also currently require's **Rosetta** on Apple Silicon Mac's, as the version of `ffmpeg` Jumper downloads is not a Universal Binary.

    ### **Final Cut Pro**

    Jumper supports **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** and later - including the latest **Final Cut Pro 11.1**.

    You can find Final Cut Pro's system requirements [here](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/specs/).

    ### **Adobe Premiere**

    Jumper supports Adobe Premiere `v24.0.0` and later.

    You can find Adobe Premiere's System Requirements [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html).

    If you're still on an earlier version of macOS and/or Premiere, you can still technically run Jumper in an **unsupported** way.

    If you right-click on `Jumper.app` in Finder, you can click **Reveal Package Contents**.

    You can then navigate to **Contents \> Helpers** and launch `JumperHelper.app`. This will install the Adobe Premiere Plugin.

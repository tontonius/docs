## What it is

Jumper is an AI-powered video editing tool designed to streamline the editing process by acting as a fast, intuitive search engine for video footage. It integrates seamlessly with popular NLEs like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve (in beta), and Avid Media Composer (in beta), allowing you to search and navigate your content without interrupting your workflow. Jumper operates entirely offline on your device, ensuring maximum speed, privacy (no cloud uploads), and the ability to work anywhere without an internet connection.

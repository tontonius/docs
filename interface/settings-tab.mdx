## Analysis folder

Sets the location of where Analysis files will be stored. 

You can browse and set a location by clicking the  <Icon icon="folder-open" iconType="duotone" size={16} /> Folder button.

You can delete the entire contents of the Analysis by clicking the  <Icon icon="trash-can" iconType="duotone" />  Trash button.

### Shared analysis folder

The analysis folder can be any location on your machine or external drives. If you set it to a location on a networked drive, make sure you have the right priviledges to read/write to that location.

### Sharing analysis files between users

<Info>
  This feature requires a Pro license
</Info>

Media already analyzed on one device will show up as analyzed (a green checkmark <Icon icon="circle-check" iconType="solid" color="#62b77f" /> in the [Media tab](/interface/media-tab) ) when imported into a project on another device.

This means multiple Jumper users can analyze media to the same networked location and share the workload of analysis.

### Swarm analysis

<Info>
  This feature requires a Pro license
</Info>

Utilize multiple computers to analyze your media in parallel, speeding up analysis time. When analyzing media to a shared location, Jumper will allocate and manage the concurrent analysis of media files between the devices. Pooling the compute resources can dramatically speed up the time to analyze media.

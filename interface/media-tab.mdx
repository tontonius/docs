## Analysis progress

When analyzing media a Analysis progess indicator is shown at the bottom of the window. In it you see the current file being analyzed, the progress of that analysis, the elapsed time of that file, the estimated time left of that file.

By clicking the X in the top right corner, you will abort the analysis of this and any other media queued for analysis.

## Show analysis files

By right-clicking a media file, you can access the analysis files of that particular file. This is handy if you want to re-analyze a file.

If you open up the `Audio analysis` you will also find two plain text files with the actual transcriptions.

1. `transcription-full-text.txt` contains the entire transcript
2. `transcription-segments.txt` contains the entire transcript but segmented with time codes
